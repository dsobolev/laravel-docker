# Docker + Laravel Notes

Laravel based project with an example of Docker environment.
It is not a fully functional project. Thing are left here like notes mostly.
Since the entire Laravel project codebase is quite large not all things are kept here.
Only files that have some meaningful changes are here with the corresponding folders structure.

## Environment

- MariaDB 57
- nginx + php-fpm
- PHP 7.3
- Laravel 8

## Configuration

Based on [this tutorial](https://liquid.fish/current/creating-a-simple-laravel-docker-environment)

### Please Note!

Code styles, formatting, clean code - all of that are not related to the project.
All things here are just the notes, and that's why there are a lot of "dirty" places, e.g. different code styles, undeleted comments, etc
